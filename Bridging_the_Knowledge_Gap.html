            <h2>What is Technical Writing?</h2>

            <h2>Why is Technical Writing Underrated?</h2>
            <p>Despite its importance, technical writing is often overlooked because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>People assume documentation is secondary to development.</li>
                <li>Many believe good products don‚Äôt need extensive documentation.</li>
                <li>It‚Äôs perceived as simple, when in reality, it requires research, clarity, and structured writing.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h2>Challenges in Working with SMEs & How Documentation Helped</h2>
            <p>In one of my projects, gathering information from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) was a major hurdle. SMEs were busy and provided inconsistent details. This led to delays and gaps in documentation.</p>
            <p><strong>How technical writing helped:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Structured Interviews:</strong> I developed a questionnaire to extract precise information.</li>
                <li><strong>Process Documentation:</strong> Created a standardized process to document SME input.</li>
                <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Maintained a version history to track updates and avoid redundant queries.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As a result, the documentation was accurate, reducing the dependency on SMEs for repeated clarifications.</p>
